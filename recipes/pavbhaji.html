            Pav Bhaji is a quintessential dish from the bustling streets of Mumbai, 
            Maharashtra, but its popularity has transcended regional boundaries, making it a
            beloved dish all across India. The name 'Pav Bhaji' is derived from two Marathi
            words: 'Pav', which means a small loaf of bread, and 'Bhaji', which means 
            vegetable.To eat Pav Bhaji, you tear off a piece of the Pav and use it to scoop
            up the Bhaji.Each bite is a delightful combination of the soft Pav, the spicy
            Bhaji, and the melted butter.
