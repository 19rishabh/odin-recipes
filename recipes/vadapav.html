            Vada Pav, often referred to as the "Indian Burger", is a popular street food in 
            Maharashtra, particularly in Mumbai. It consists of a spicy potato filling 
            deep-fried in a gram flour batter, known as the 'vada', sandwiched between a 
            'pav', which is a type of Indian bread roll. The vada pav is typically served 
            with a variety of chutneys like tamarind and green chutney, and sometimes even
            with fried green chillies for an extra kick. The combination of the soft bread,
            crispy vada, and tangy chutneys makes it a delicious and satisfying snack 
            that's loved by people of all ages.
